# React Hooks Practice

## Understanding and practicing all 9 core hooks from React:

- <ins>useState</ins> - It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. 
- <ins>useReducer</ins> - Use when the state becomes complex, with state values depending on each other or when the next state depends on the previous one.
- <ins>useEffect</ins> - Use this Hook to tell React that your component needs to do something after render. e.g fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
- <ins>useRef</ins> - 
- useLayoutEffect
- useImperativeHandle
- useContext
- useMemo
- useCallback
